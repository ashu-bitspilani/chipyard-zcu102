Description: 
Set a parameter value

Syntax: 
set_param  [-quiet] [-verbose] <name> <value>

Returns: 
newly set parameter value

Usage: 
  Name        Description
  -----------------------
  [-quiet]    Ignore command errors
  [-verbose]  Suspend message limits during command execution
  <name>      Parameter name
  <value>     Parameter value

Categories: 
PropertyAndParameter

Description:

  Sets the value of a user-definable configuration parameter. These
  parameters configure and control various behaviors of the tool. Refer to
  report_param for a description of currently defined parameters.

  As an example, a specific param that can be defined is the
  general.maxThreads parameter for the Vivado Design Suite. On multiprocessor
  systems, the Vivado Design Suite use multi-threading to speed up certain
  processes, including DRC reporting, static timing analysis, placement, and
  routing. A default limit applies to all tasks and is based on the operating
  system. For Windows systems, the default is 2; for Linux systems the
  default is 8. The limit can be changed as follows:

    set_param general.maxThreads <value>  
    

  Where <value> is an integer from 1 to 8, inclusive.

  The maximum number of simultaneous threads that can be used also varies by
  the task being run. You can change the maxThreads parameter prior to
  running these processes. The maximum number of threads for specific Tcl
  commands are:

   *  phys_opt_design: 8

   *  place_design: 8

   *  report_drc: 8

   *  report_timing and report_timing_summary: 8

   *  route_design: 8

   *  synth_design: 4

  You can use the reset_param command to restore any parameter that has been
  modified back to its default setting.

  Note: Setting a specified parameter value to -1 will disable the feature.

Arguments:

  <name> - (Required) The name of the parameter to set the value of. You can
  only set the value of one parameter at a time.

  <value> - (Required) The value to set the specified parameter to.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example sets the parameter defining how many threads to run
  for multi-threaded processes, including Placement, Routing, and Timing
  Analysis:

    set_param general.maxThreads 4 
    

  Note: The Vivado tool supports between 1 to 8 threads. Use get_param to
  determine the current setting.

  The following example sets a new default value for message limit:

    set_param messaging.defaultLimit 1000

For more details on setting the scan chain property, consult the Vivado Debug and Programming User Guide (UG908).
